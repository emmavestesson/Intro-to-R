# Housekeeping

Slido/chat for interaction 

Questions in chat or just interrupt me 

Please stay muted unless you are asking a question 

Cameras on or off – always nice to see people’s faces but it is your choice 

45min + 15 break final session will be 30 min

#slido time!

# Aim of this morning


Make you familiar with R 

Show the possibilities of R  - focus on plotting

Make you comfortable to learn more own your own or in more advanced courses 

---
# What is R?

R is an *open source* programming language [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/)

Open source is closely linked to open science

```{r, out.width='25%',  echo = FALSE, fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png')
```

--

Popular in academia and industry 

RStudio is the most popular interface (IDE) - free to download [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/)

R packages – this is where most of the functionality comes from [CRAN package repository](https://cran.r-project.org/)

---

# Environment today

RStudio cloud 

Easy to sign up (eg using a google account) 

Got to RStudio cloud now 

---

# Tour of RStudio

Console – interactive (show how to create objects) 

Environment – any data or objects will be saved here 

Files/plots/packages/help -  files 

Scripts – good practice to save your code 

---

# Did you have a play with RStudio? 

---

# Packages
class: centre, middle

The first time you use a package you need to install the package. 

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Load the package

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

What package is the function `left_join` from? 

What arguments are needed in the `ggplot` function?

## The pipe

Simplifying R code with pipes (%>%)


nested statement
```r
leave_house(get_dressed(get_out_of_bed(wake_up(me))))
```
VS

piped statement
```r
me %>% 
  wake_up() %>% 
  get_out_of_bed() %>% 
  get_dressed() %>% 
  leave_house()
```

# Loading data

R native data sets 

Able to handle most file formats – excel, csv, .dta, ssd01 but also parquet files (`haven`, `arrow` packages)

R can connect to databases eg most flavours of sql 

R can have multiple dataset in memory at once 

R can access data stored locally or on the web 
---
# read in our first csv


- file>import data set
```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv('path_to_file/file_mame.csv')
```

# Gapminder data set

- "Gapminder is an independent educational non-proﬁt ﬁghting global misconceptions"
- Downloaded using `gapminder` package
- Based on free material from GAPMINDER.ORG, CC-BY LICENSE
---
class: inverse, middle, center
# Let's head over to RStudio to look at the gapminder package 
---
# Tidyverse
- A set of packages with consistent syntax 

- Very popular and well documented 

- Vignettes - tutorial styled blogs

- ggplot2 – plot data 

- dplyr – manipulate data 




---

---

## ggplot2 syntax

- Based on the grammar of graphics - build your plots layer by layer

- Comes with infinite tweaks 

- Part of the tidyverse but there are also extension eg `ggdogs`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_date() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme()
  
```



---

# Go back to Rstudio and gapminder (5 min) 

Create a scatter plot of life expectancy and GDP per capita 

Prettify plots – add a theme, change the colour of the points

---

- ==, >, >= etc

- &, |, !, xor()

- is.na()

- between(), near()

- %in%

class: middle, centre
# Let's create a smaller data set using filter and plot it

---
# Functions to use with mutate
- +, -, log(), etc., for their usual mathematical meanings

- lead(), lag()

- dense_rank(), min_rank(), percent_rank(), row_number(), cume_dist(), ntile()

- cumsum(), cummean(), cummin(), cummax(), cumany(), cumall()

- na_if(), coalesce()

- if_else(), recode(), case_when()


---

# Let's create a new variable

---
# Select

Operates on variables. It keeps or drops variables

```{r, eval= FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  select(pop, year)
```

variables are dropped by adding *-*
```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  select(-country)
```
---
# Functions to use with select

- `everything()`: Matches all variables.

- `last_col()`: Select last variable, possibly with an offset.

- `starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix.

- `ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix.

- `contains()`: Contains a literal string.

- `matches()`: Matches a regular expression.

- `num_range()`: Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03.

- `where()`: Applies a function to all variables and selects those for which the function returns TRUE (eg `is.character()`).
---

# summarise (or summarize)

- similar to mutate but collapses your data set
- often paired with `group_by()`
---

# Let's summarise and plot  the data

# Publication ready tables


- Package called `gtsummary `

- Relies on a broom and broom.mixed for regression models 

- Closely linked to gt package 
- Tables can be saved in multiple formats – good to know the final format  

---
# Crosstable

Two variables

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
trial %>% 
  tbl_cross(trt, response)
```

---

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
trial %>% 
  tbl_cross(trt, response, percent = 'col')
```


---

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
trial %>% 
  tbl_cross(trt, response, percent = 'row') %>% 
  add_p()
```

---
# Table 1

```{r}
  trial %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = trt,
    label = list(age = "Patient Age")
  )
```

---

```{r}
  trial %>%
  tbl_summary(
    by = trt,
    label = list(age = "Patient Age")
  ) %>% 
  add_p()
```

---

# Regression table

```{r}
  glm(response ~ age + grade, trial, family = binomial(link = "logit")) %>%
  tbl_regression(exponentiate = TRUE)
```
