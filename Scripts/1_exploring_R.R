# use R as a calculator



# writing example (words, number of days, words per day)


words <- 
number_of_days <- 
words_per_day <- words/days

# what happens if the deadline is moved so that I get 3 more days?

# vectors (cumulative sum of words over time)



# functions (mean of a vector, sum of a vector)
